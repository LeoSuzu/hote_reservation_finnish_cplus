## Hotel Reservation System

This is a simple hotel reservation system implemented in C++. It allows users to make room reservations, cancel reservations, and calculate room charges based on the number of nights and room type. The system uses an array of room structures to store room information and reservation details.

**Features**

* Make a Reservation: Users can make room reservations by selecting a room number and providing their name. The system checks for room availability and assigns the reservation details to the corresponding room structure.

* Cancel a Reservation: Users can cancel a reservation by providing either the reservation number or their name. The system searches for the reservation and marks the room as available for future bookings.

* Calculate Room Charges: The system calculates the room charges based on the number of nights and the room type. It applies discount percentages randomly to the room charge.

3. To cancel a reservation, choose the "Cancel a Reservation" option and provide either the reservation number or your name.

4. To calculate room charges, choose the "Calculate Room Charges" option and follow the instructions.

5. Choose the "Exit" option to exit the program.
